This app lets you rate multiple wines and their characteristics. App then stores this data into browsers local storage. From "My wines" -view you are able to see all the different wines that you have rated. By clicking a wine in the list you can view all the rating data stored. You can also sort the list by clicking different columns.

## About

This was about a week long project in early 2021. I got an assignment from my School to build a React app that includes technologies learned in our Software Developement 1 course.

Technologies used: React, React router and Material-Ui

(Iknow about the lack of commenting in my code. I will do better on the next project.)
